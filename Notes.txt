04/17/14
	began work on key signature class - all keys mapped to an array of action indices
04/27/14
	key signature class complete with sparse array, simultaneous key presses, and mapped to actions in Jned
	Button push method handles unpushing of group
	Multibuttons and buttons both implement Pushable interface
	tile/items/enemies/sub buttons all work with key shortcuts, including diagonal directions for launchpad
04/28/14
	keyboard shortcuts for drone behaviors, show/hide/toggle triggers and paths, undo/redo, textbox operations, copy/paste/cut, and nudging
	mouse move method now stores mouse point in item selection mode using orow/ocol. Necessary for proper pasting via keyboard shortcuts (and later bar menu)
04.31.14
	keyboard shortcuts for gridlines, snapping, and snap points. Framework for arbitrary additional shortcuts for custom grid and snap settings
05.01.14
	beginning of KeyShortcuts window: Frame, layout, buttons (don't work yet). Creation of PanelButton and KeySetting classes. 
05.03.14
	KeySetting class linked to KeySignature. Methods for returning action and key names from action numbers. KeyShortcuts window lists all actions.
05.06.14
	KeySignature has dialog for changing keys with own listener, can add, remove, and change key settings. Changes are kept in 'custom' key settings in config.
	Collisions handled with a dialog.
05.07.14
	Key setting presets can be saved and deleted just like grid and snap settings
05.08.14
	Grid and snap save/delete drop panels switched to dialog windows. Key shortcuts frame switched to non-modal dialog. File chooser started.
05.11.14
	File chooser set up. Buttons and level list in place. Button pushes do not yet do anything.
05.14.14
	Text boxes for each field added in save mode of file chooser. Selection of levels works. Open and Cancel buttons work. Debug of item indices in level area (decimal player position would mess it up)
05.15.14
	Level selection in save mode fills in text fields. Overwrite dialog added. Saving works. File chooser accessed from Jned menu 'Save', 'Save As', and 'Open' commands.
06.03.14
	File path choosing for levels file in open/save dialog. Persistant.
06.04.14
	File io no longer hogs access to userlevels file. Can go back and forth between saving/loading levels and playing them in n

	backslash clicking for deleting objects in reverse order
	allow for decimal player positions
	change door trigger line color (same as tiles presently)
	get rid of the grid
	add item menus to edit menu
	gridlines/view snap points/drone paths/door triggers for view menu
	debug launchpad - sometimes won't reverse direction when editing power - different mouse interface needed
	launch pad values textfields in drop-down menu, or perhaps lefthand buttons
	drone path length setting
	teleporter button
