1 - SETTING UP AND RUNNING THE APPLICATION

Setting up Jned is a breeze. Just download, unzip, and it's ready to go. To run,
you'll need to have Java installed on your computer. If you don't have the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, you can download it from the Oracle website:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Jned was created using version 7, so any Java version 7 or up should be sufficient.

If you are unfamiliar with running a java application, the next step may not be
obvious. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder containing
Jned. Then, type the command:

java Jned

and hit enter. It should start up. If you get an error telling you the command "java"
is unrecognized, you either haven't installed the JRE, or you need to tell your
computer where to look for the definition of the command "java". This is
done using a path variable. You can find instructions for this at:
